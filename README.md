# Turn Indication Example

The Turn Indicator example is provided as a guiding example for using test automation and model checking within the
[INTO-CPS project](http://into-cps.au.dk/ "INTO-CPS Website").
It consists of a simplified behavioral model of a car's turn indicator lights.
This model has been purposefully reduced in complexity in order to be easy to grasp.
The full-featured model is available
[here](http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/agbs/testingbenchmarks/turn_indicator/index_e.html "Turn Indicator Model").

The example can be opened using the [INTO-CPS application](https://github.com/into-cps/intocps-ui).
As a starting point some test-procedures and LTL model checking queries have been pre-configured.
